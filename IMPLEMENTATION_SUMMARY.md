# Moments App - Implementation Summary

## 🎉 What Was Accomplished

I've completed the next phase of implementation for the Moments prediction market app based on the detailed requirements in `TECH.md`. Here's what's been built:

---

## 📊 Database Architecture

### Updated Prisma Schema (`web-app/prisma/schema.prisma`)

Completely redesigned to match TECH.md specifications:

**Core Models:**
- ✅ **User** - Full profile with stats (totalPredictions, correctPredictions, totalEarnings, battleWins/Losses, streaks)
- ✅ **Post** - Prediction markets with media, NFT attachments, volume tracking, engagement metrics
- ✅ **Prediction** - User bets with blockchain tracking, status, potential winnings
- ✅ **Battle** - NFT vs NFT battles with community betting pools
- ✅ **BattleBet** - Individual bets on battle outcomes
- ✅ **Achievement** - Unlockable badges with NFT minting support
- ✅ **Follow** - Social connections between users
- ✅ **Comment** - Post comments with denormalized user data
- ✅ **Notification** - User notifications system
- ✅ **LeaderboardCache** - Performance optimization for rankings

**Key Features:**
- Proper relations between all models
- Decimal types for precise FLOW amounts
- Comprehensive indexing for query performance
- Cascade deletes where appropriate
- Unique constraints to prevent duplicates

## 🔄 What You Need to Do Next

### 1. Generate Prisma Client (CRITICAL)
```bash
cd web-app
pnpm prisma generate
```
This will fix all TypeScript lint errors.

### 2. Push Schema to Database
```bash
pnpm prisma db push
```
This syncs your schema with PostgreSQL.

### 3. Test the App
```bash
pnpm dev
```
Visit http://localhost:3000

### 4. Key Pages to Test
- `/admin` - Resolve markets
- `/leaderboard` - View rankings
- `/battles` - See battle arena
- `/create` - Create prediction (needs media upload)
- `/feed` - Needs database integration
