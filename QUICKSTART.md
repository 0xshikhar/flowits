   - Implements `DeFiActions.Sink`
   - Composable prediction placement
   - Discoverable via metadata
   - **KEY FOR WINNING FLOW FORTE TRACK**

3. **NFTBattle.cdc** - NFT battle system
   - Stake NFTs in battles
   - Community betting
   - Winner takes all

4. **AchievementNFT.cdc** - Soulbound achievements
   - Non-transferable NFTs
   - Unlocked via milestones
   - Can be auto-minted via scheduled transactions

### ‚úÖ Frontend (Gamified Light Theme)

## üéØ Flow Actions Integration (Forte Track)

### How It Works

```cadence
// Traditional approach
PredictionMarket.placePrediction(marketId, user, outcome, payment)

// Flow Actions approach (composable!)
let predictionSink = PredictionActions.createPredictionAction(
  marketId: 1,
  outcome: "yes",
  userAddress: signer.address
)
predictionSink.depositCapacity(from: vaultRef)
```

### Why This Wins

1. **Composability** - Can chain with other DeFi protocols
2. **Discoverability** - Metadata makes it findable by AI agents
3. **Standardization** - Follows FLIP-338 spec
4. **Automation** - Enables complex workflows

### Demo Points

- Show prediction via Action in transaction
- Explain composability benefits
- Highlight metadata/discovery
- Compare with traditional approach

## üèÜ Dapper Integration Strategy

### NBA Top Shot / NFL All Day

```typescript
// Read user's NFTs
const moments = await getNBATopShotMoments(userAddress)

// Display in UI
// Attach to prediction posts
// Use in NFT battles
```

### Contract Addresses (Mainnet)

- NBA Top Shot: `0x0b2a3299cc857e29`
- NFL All Day: `0xe4cf4bdc1751c65d`
