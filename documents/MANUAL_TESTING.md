## üìù Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Create & Query Market

#### Step 1: Create Market

```bash
cd contracts

# Calculate future timestamp (1 hour from now)
FUTURE_TIME=$(python3 -c "import time; print(time.time() + 3600)")

# Create market
flow transactions send \
  cadence/transactions/create_market.cdc \
  "Will LeBron score 40+ points tonight?" \
  $FUTURE_TIME \
  1.0 \
  5.0 \
  --network=emulator \
  --signer=emulator-account
```

**Expected**: Transaction succeeds, market ID 0 created

#### Step 2: Query Market

```bash
flow scripts execute \
  cadence/scripts/get_market_info.cdc \
  0 \
  --network=emulator
```

**Expected Output**:
```json
{
  "marketId": 0,
  "creator": "0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7",
  "question": "Will LeBron score 40+ points tonight?",
  "closeTime": 1234567890.0,
  "minStake": 1.0,
  "creatorFeePercent": 5.0,
  "isResolved": false,
  "winningOutcome": null,
  "totalYesVolume": 0.0,
  "totalNoVolume": 0.0
}
```

---

### Scenario 2: Place Prediction (Traditional)

```bash
# Place YES prediction with 5 FLOW
flow transactions send \
  cadence/transactions/place_prediction.cdc \
  0 \
  "yes" \
  5.0 \
  --network=emulator \
  --signer=emulator-account
```

**Expected**: Transaction succeeds

#### Verify Prediction

```bash
flow scripts execute \
  cadence/scripts/get_user_prediction.cdc \
  0 \
  "0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7" \
  --network=emulator
```

**Expected Output**:
```json
{
  "outcome": "yes",
  "amount": 5.0,
  "claimed": false
}
```

#### Verify Market Updated

```bash
flow scripts execute \
  cadence/scripts/get_market_info.cdc \
  0 \
  --network=emulator
```

**Expected**: `totalYesVolume` should be 5.0

---

### Scenario 3: Place Prediction via Flow Actions ‚≠ê

```bash
# Place prediction using Flow Actions
flow transactions send \
  cadence/transactions/place_prediction_via_action.cdc \
  0 \
  "no" \
  3.0 \
  --network=emulator \
  --signer=emulator-account
```

**Expected**: Transaction succeeds

#### Verify Both Predictions

```bash
# Check market info
flow scripts execute \
  cadence/scripts/get_market_info.cdc \
  0 \
  --network=emulator
```

**Expected**:
- `totalYesVolume`: 5.0
- `totalNoVolume`: 3.0
- Total pool: 8.0 FLOW

---

### Scenario 4: Resolve Market & Claim Winnings

#### Step 1: Wait for Market to Close

```bash
# For testing, create a market that closes in 5 seconds
FUTURE_TIME=$(python3 -c "import time; print(time.time() + 5)")

flow transactions send \
  cadence/transactions/create_market.cdc \
  "Quick test market" \
  $FUTURE_TIME \
  1.0 \
  5.0 \
  --network=emulator \
  --signer=emulator-account

# Place predictions
flow transactions send \
  cadence/transactions/place_prediction.cdc \
  1 \
  "yes" \
  10.0 \
  --network=emulator \
  --signer=emulator-account

# Wait 6 seconds
sleep 6
```

#### Step 2: Resolve Market

```bash
flow transactions send \
  cadence/transactions/resolve_market.cdc \
  1 \
  "yes" \
  --network=emulator \
  --signer=emulator-account
```

**Expected**: Transaction succeeds, market resolved

#### Step 3: Claim Winnings

```bash
flow transactions send \
  cadence/transactions/claim_winnings.cdc \
  1 \
  --network=emulator \
  --signer=emulator-account
```

**Expected**: Transaction succeeds, winnings claimed

## üîç Verification Commands

### Check Contract Deployment

```bash
flow accounts get 0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7 --network=emulator
```

**Expected**: Shows deployed contracts

### Check Account Balance

```bash
flow accounts get 0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7 --network=emulator | grep Balance
```

**Expected**: Shows FLOW balance (should be ~1000 FLOW on emulator)

### List All Markets

```bash
# Check nextMarketId
flow scripts execute \
  -c "import PredictionMarket from 0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7; access(all) fun main(): UInt64 { return PredictionMarket.nextMarketId }" \
  --network=emulator
```

**Expected**: Returns number of markets created

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Transaction Fails

**Check**:
1. Emulator is running
2. Contracts are deployed
3. Arguments are correct type
4. Account has sufficient FLOW

**Debug**:
```bash
# Check emulator logs in the terminal where it's running
# Look for error messages
```

### Issue: Script Returns Nil

**Possible Causes**:
- Market doesn't exist (wrong ID)
- User hasn't placed prediction
- Contract not deployed

**Verify**:
```bash
# Check if market exists
flow scripts execute cadence/scripts/get_market_info.cdc 0 --network=emulator
```

### Issue: "Market Not Found"

**Solution**:
- Use correct market ID (starts at 0)
- Verify market was created successfully
- Check `nextMarketId` to see how many markets exist
