3. **Performance**
   - Add caching for leaderboards
   - Optimize database queries with proper indexes

4. **Security**
   - Add admin authentication check
   - Validate user ownership before operations

## 📝 Next Actions

### Immediate (Today)
1. Run `pnpm prisma generate` in web-app
2. Test database connection
3. Update feed page to fetch from database
4. Fix create page transaction handling

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Implement media upload
2. Create battle creation flow
3. Add scheduled transactions
4. Write FORTE_INTEGRATION.md

### Before Demo
1. End-to-end testing
2. Deploy to Vercel
