## üìä Test Coverage

### Contract Tests
- ‚úÖ Market creation
- ‚úÖ Prediction placement (traditional)
- ‚úÖ Prediction placement (Flow Actions)
- ‚úÖ Market resolution
- ‚úÖ Winnings claim
- ‚úÖ NFT battle creation
- ‚úÖ Achievement minting

### Frontend Tests
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compiles (with expected FCL warnings)
- ‚úÖ All pages render

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### TypeScript Warnings (Non-blocking)

**Issue**: FCL v1.12 authorization type mismatches in `transactions.ts`

**Impact**: None - works correctly at runtime

**Solution**: Suppressed with type casting:
```typescript
const getAuthz = () => fcl.currentUser.authorization as any
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Safe to ignore
